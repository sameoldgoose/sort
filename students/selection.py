# time complexity of O(n^2)

# Explanation of the selection sort algorithm:
# The selection sort algorithm divides the array into two parts: the sorted part and the unsorted part.
# In each iteration, it finds the minimum element in the remaining unsorted part of the array.
# The minimum element is then swapped with the current element, placing it in its correct position in the sorted part.
# This process continues until the entire array is sorted.
def selection_sort(arr):
    # Traverse the array from 0 to n-1
    
        # Find the minimum element in the remaining unsorted part of the array
        

        # Swap the minimum element with the current element
        

# Test the selection sort algorithm
array = 
print("Original array:", array)
selection_sort(array)
print("Sorted array:", array)
